Each year, solving Advent of Code is a sort of bet with myself. <br/>
I started with plain Python in 2015, and went through the years, learning new languages I should not have learnt like Rust (which unfortunately I didn't fully got familiar with).<br/>
<br/>
This year, I kind of raised the bar, deciding around the beginning of November to write an interpreter for a new language, and then solving Advent of Code with it.<br/>
